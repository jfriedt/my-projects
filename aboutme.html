      <p>I am a current high school student at Benicia High School. I love fashion, taking pictures, running, and dogs. I've played soccer my entire life and have ran track and cross country since freshman year of high school. I plan to major in computer science and minor in business when I reach college. Above is a link to my Weebly site where you can check out some of my other artwork. :)</p>
