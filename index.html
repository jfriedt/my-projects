        <h2>Scratch Game: Act 9</h2>
        <p><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/418265768">Scratch</a></p>
        <p>Here's a game I designed in Scratch! I spent an upwards of 10 hours total on all 9 projects. I decided to use a similar model to another game example we had, thus creating this! This game was made in early August of 2020, right before the school year. The goal is to touch the iceburg. When you do, you'll recieve and point and another enemy will spawn. See how many points you can get!</p>

        <p>This is my group project picture using Python! Our group decided to each take a corner of the page and add icons and designs that we thought matched us! I chose a medal, a soccer ball, a camera, and a rainbow for mine! Both the medal and soccer ball represent the sports I play, the camera for my love of fashion and modeling, and the rainbow to emphasize my colorful and loud personality.</p>

        <h2>Genius Hour</h2>
        <p><a href="https://www.ucdavis.edu/">UC Davis Home</a></p>
        <p>Over these past few weeks, for my Genius Hour I've attended multiple seminars on computer science and engineering. Women from UC Davis, California have held zooms exclusively for people who identify as women and want to learn more about careers in engineering. I've learned how much each career makes, how to find help within the college campus and programs, and what exactly each job needs and what they look for. This experience has taught me a lot and has mademy love for computer science and engineering grow!</p>
